CompCoopEnvPaper is a repository for the code used to generate data in 'Competition and cooperation: the plasticity of bacterial interactions across environments'.
We run metabolic models for pairs of bacteria from the AGORA and CarveMe collections.
The purpose of this code is to randomly search different environments for competitive, cooperative or other types of pairwise interactions.

Sample metabolic models have been provided so that the code can be run.

The stats folder contains more code that was used to produce the plots and statistical analysis in our paper.
