CompCoopEnvPaper is a repository for the code used to generate data in 'Competition and cooperation: the plasticity of bacterial interactions across environments'.
We run metabolic models for pairs of bacteria from the AGORA and CarveMe collections.
THe purpose of this code is to randomly search different environments for competitive, cooperative or other types of pairwise interactions.
